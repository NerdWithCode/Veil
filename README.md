# Veil
A small, timed maze-like game I created (With some rather strong influence from LoZ: Skyward Sword)

-Veil 1.0 release-  The .exe and other files neccessary to run the game
-src-               All source files and resources, including a VS Express file for the project
-GUI-               An executable w/ resources to create the .veil files the game will run off. Further instructions included

Note about the source code: This was written around Sept 2018 - March 2019 before I learnt about multiple .cpp files, and as a casual
project. Therefore the layout of the code may involve some bad practices that more recent projects will have avoided. Please do not take
it as an example of my programming style.
